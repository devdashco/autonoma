/**
 * Reduce a snapshot's per-run context (gathered by the `DiffJobContextLoader`)
 * to the actionable {@link RunReviewVerdict[]} the resolution agent handles.
 *
 * Three classes of run are dropped, mirroring what resolution can act on:
 * passed runs (the test still works), quarantined tests (excluded from replay,
 * owned by manual review), and runs without a completed reviewer verdict
 * (nothing to attribute yet). The drops are logged per-slug for observability.
 *
 * Each surviving run carries its materialized scenario data straight through, so
 * the agent can tell a stale test (references data the scenario never created)
 * from a real bug.
