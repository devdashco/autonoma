/**
 * Runs the generation pipeline for everything currently pending in the snapshot:
 *
 *   1. Queue every pending gen (`prepareGenerationQueue`).
 *   2. Fire `batchGenerationWorkflow` and wait. After the batch returns, every
 *      generation row is in a terminal status and its review activity has run
 *      (single-generation's finally block awaits the review).
 *
 * A generation passing its review is the definition of "validated" - there is
 * no replay step. Reviews are awaited inside the gen finally block, so by the
 * time this workflow returns every generation row's review has a terminal
 * status and the next iteration's analyzeResults can safely read them.
 *
 * Pre: the set of pending gens in the snapshot at call time equals the scope
 * the current iteration owns. The refinement loop maintains this invariant.
 *
 * No return value - outcomes land in DB.
