/**
 * The previewkit deploy contract: the plain, serializable data shared between

 * Job) and `apps/previewkit` (the runner that executes it). Kept dependency-free
 * - only scalars, string maps, and flat result rows - so it can cross the API ->
 * Job boundary as JSON. The rich preview config crosses as a JSON string
 * (`mergedConfigJson`) and is re-validated with `trustedPreviewConfigSchema`
 * inside the runner.
