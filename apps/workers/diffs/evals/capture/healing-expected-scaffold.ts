TODO: author the LLM-judge rubric here.

The judge sees only the agent's structured output plus this body - never the
codebase or screenshots. Grade qualities the deterministic checks cannot express:
  - For each \`update_plan\`: does the \`newPrompt\` address the cited failure?
    Is it specific enough? Does it preserve the test's original intent?
  - For each \`report_bug\` / \`report_engine_limitation\` / \`report_unknown_issue\`: is the
    triage correct (grounded application defect vs. engine/agent limitation vs. a suspected
    bug that couldn't be grounded in code)? For \`report_bug\`, is the \`suspectedCause\`
    genuinely grounded? Are the description and severity proportionate to the cited reasoning?
  - For each \`remove_test\`: is the cited reason plausible given the failure
    context - i.e. an invalid test born this snapshot or a feature removed from
    the app, not a pre-existing test that merely fails?
Keep every point additive to the frontmatter, and phrase each as something
checkable from the structured output alone.
