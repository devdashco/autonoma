TODO: author the LLM-judge rubric here.

The judge sees only the agent's structured output plus this body - never the
codebase or screenshots. Grade qualities the deterministic checks above cannot
express (e.g. is each new-test instruction clear and on-topic? is the modify
reasoning sound? does the bug report accurately describe the failure?). Keep
every point additive to the frontmatter, and phrase each as something
checkable from the output alone.
