The judge sees only the agent's structured output plus this body - never the
codebase or screenshots. Grade qualities the deterministic checks above cannot
express (was the reasoning sound? are the suggested test candidates sensible and
on-topic? was the right rationale given?). Keep every point additive to the
frontmatter, and phrase each as something checkable from the output alone.
