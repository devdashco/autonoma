# Diffs pipeline evals

Local, per-step, **scored** evaluations for the diffs pipeline - the replacement for
the eyeball-only local-dev scripts. Each step keeps a corpus of on-disk cases and
scores the agent's output with **deterministic frontmatter checks plus an LLM judge**.

Four steps are currently under eval: **Diff Analysis**, **Generation Review**,
**Replay Review**, and **Diff Healing**. The reviewer evals additionally exercise
the **multimedia rehydration path** - they download screenshots + the recording
from S3 at run time via the production evidence loader. No media bytes are ever
committed.

Diff Resolution no longer has its own step. The Resolution agent was folded into
the Healing agent as iteration 1 of the refinement loop, so a first-turn case
(the affected-test replay failures) is now just another Healing fixture -
captured and graded through the single Healing capture/eval path described below.
New tests are authored upstream by the diffs agent (`create_test`); healing only
heals and culls, so it has no test-authoring channel to grade.

Each step lives in its own subdirectory (`<step>/`) with the same four files
(`<step>-input.ts` schema, `<step>-frontmatter.ts` deterministic checks,
`<step>-evaluation.ts` Evaluation subclass, `<step>.eval.ts` vitest entry).
Step-agnostic primitives live in `framework/`; each step also has a
`capture-<step>.ts` library and a `capture-<step>-cli.ts` entry under `capture/`,
both wired through the package's `capture:<step>` scripts.

## Where the cases live (private corpus)

The eval **harness** (this directory) is open source. The eval **cases** are
not: a captured case carries client data - test-plan prompts, plan/scenario
content (including fixtures that may hold seeded credentials), client repo
owner/name, S3 keys, and model conversations. So the corpus lives in a separate
**private** repo (`autonoma/eval-cases`) and is **never committed here**. The
`**/cases/` paths are gitignored as a safety net.

The harness reads the corpus from a configurable, optional root,
`DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR`, validated in `evals/framework/env.ts`. The private repo
mirrors the public `evals/<step>/cases` layout - `DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR` simply
stands in for the `evals/` prefix - so each step resolves its cases to
`${DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR}/<step>/cases/<name>/`.

```
some-parent/
├── <this-repo>/apps/workers/diffs/evals/   # harness (public)
└── eval-cases/                              # corpus (private), DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR
    ├── analysis/cases/<name>/
    ├── generation-review/cases/<name>/
    ├── replay-review/cases/<name>/
    └── healing/cases/<name>/
```

**Local setup:** clone the private repo alongside this one and point the env var
at it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:autonoma/eval-cases.git
export DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR="$(pwd)/eval-cases"
```

- **Unset / missing directory:** every suite resolves **zero cases and no-ops**
  (it does not fail), so public CI and external contributors are never broken.
  Public CI never sets the var.
- **Set:** cases load from `${DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR}/<step>/cases`.
- Capture commands **write into the same root** and **error with a clear
  message** when it is unset (capture genuinely needs somewhere to write).

A case may carry an optional `schemaVersion` in its frontmatter; the loader
**warns** (never fails) when it differs from `CASE_SCHEMA_VERSION` in
`framework/frontmatter.ts`, surfacing corpus-vs-harness drift without coupling
the two repos.

## The eval-case contract

Each case is a folder under `${DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR}/<step>/cases/<name>/` (see
[Where the cases live](#where-the-cases-live-private-corpus)):

- **`input.json`** - the **frozen, assembled `XxxAgentInput`**, snapshotted at capture time so
  eval runs need no database. The codebase is stored as coordinates
  `{ owner, repo, installationId, baseSha, headSha }`; the `FlowIndex` / `ScenarioIndex` are
  stored as their underlying arrays and reconstructed at load.
- **`expected.md`** - YAML frontmatter holds the **deterministic checks**; the body holds the
  **LLM-judge rubric**. A case passes iff **all frontmatter checks pass AND the judge passes**.

### Analysis frontmatter

```yaml
---
description: "what this case exercises"   # optional, ignored by checks
skip: false                                # when true, the case is loaded but not run
affected:                                  # checks over the affected-test slug set
  include: [slug-a]                        #   must be present
  exclude: [slug-b]                        #   must be absent
  exact: [slug-a, slug-c]                  #   the exact set (order-insensitive)
---

Free-text judge rubric. The judge sees only the agent's structured output plus this
body - never the codebase or screenshots. Write it ADDITIVE to the frontmatter: grade
qualities the deterministic checks cannot (sound reasoning; non-redundant, on-topic
tests authored via `create_test` with a clear coverage justification).
```

The diffs agent now authors tests directly via `create_test` (no candidate
pre-gate). Grading the quality of those authored tests - dedup discipline,
coverage justification - is a substantive judge concern (tracked in #1035), not a
count-bounds check.

### Reviewer frontmatter (generation + replay)

Both reviewer evals share the same shape. Only `verdict` is graded
deterministically; the reviewer's other fields (`title`, `reasoning`,
`failurePoint`, `evidence`) are free-text and graded by the judge rubric. The
verdict enum differs per reviewer:
`success | agent_limitation | application_bug | plan_mismatch` for generation,
`engine_error | application_bug` for replay.

```yaml
---
description: "what this case exercises"
skip: false
verdict: application_bug      # enum-equality (per-reviewer enum)
---

Free-text judge rubric. The judge sees only the reviewer's structured verdict plus
this body - never the codebase, conversation, screenshots, or video. Grade qualities
the deterministic verdict check cannot: does the reasoning cite the actual failure
point, no hallucinated steps, correct engine-vs-app attribution?
```

### Healing frontmatter

Healing only heals and culls; it authors no tests, so the frontmatter grades a
single channel. `expectedActions` grades the **per-failure action union**: a modify
is `update_plan`, a removal is `remove_test`, a bug is `report_bug` /
`report_engine_limitation`.

```yaml
---
description: "what this case exercises"
skip: false
expectedActions:                  # one entry per failing test case in input.json
    tc-abc: update_plan           # the kind the agent must emit for this test case
    tc-def: report_bug
    tc-ghi: remove_test
---
Free-text judge rubric. Grade qualities the deterministic check cannot:
    - For each update_plan: does the newPrompt actually address the cited failure?
    - For each report_bug / report_engine_limitation: is the triage correct?
    - For each remove_test: is the cited reason plausible given the failure context?
```

Healing's runtime invariant is that every input failure is handled by exactly one
action (the agent loop throws otherwise). The eval mirrors that: the `expectedActions`
keyset must equal the set of `failures[].testCaseId` in `input.json`. A partial or
mismatched map throws at load time rather than at run time.

### Multimedia rehydration

The reviewer evals download every step screenshot + the run video from S3 at
agent run time via the production `StorageEvidenceLoader` - the same loader the
production reviewer uses. Before the agent starts the harness calls
`probeEvidence(...)` to walk every referenced key and surface a typed
`MissingEvidenceError` if any key has been rotated away. A case in that state
skips with a warning the same way an unfetchable SHA does.

Captured `input.json` files store media as **S3 keys**, never bytes. Generation
review additionally stores the agent conversation, with image parts stripped at
capture time via `sanitizeConversation` so the fixture stays text-only.

### Legacy scenario-data recovery (Reviewers)

Instances that ran **before #822** have a null `ScenarioInstance.generatedData`,
so the production loader omits `context.scenario`. To still capture them with
scenario context, the reviewer captures fall back to the **webhook log**: when
the loader returns no scenario, capture reads the surviving `UP`
`webhook_call.request_body.create` (byte-identical to `generatedData`) and
materializes it the same way. This is eval-only (`capture/recover-scenario-data*.ts`);
the shared resolvers and `DiffJobContextLoader` are unchanged. A populated
`generatedData` always wins; recovery is skipped when there is no instance, it
never came up, or no `UP` webhook survives.

## Running the evals

Evals are gated behind `RUN_EVALS` and need `DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR` pointed at the
private corpus (see [Where the cases live](#where-the-cases-live-private-corpus)) - with it
unset the suites collect, resolve **zero cases, and pass**. They also need real model credentials
(`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) plus `git` and `rg` on PATH. Private-repo
cases also need the `GITHUB_APP_*` credentials to mint a clone token; public-repo cases and cases
whose commits are already in the repo cache run without them.

```bash
export DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR=/path/to/eval-cases
pnpm --filter @autonoma/worker-diffs eval
```

- The suite runs **sequentially** - every case shares one on-disk working tree in the gitignored
  repo cache (`evals/.cache/repos/`), so concurrent checkouts are impossible.
- A case whose `baseSha`/`headSha` can no longer be fetched **skips with a warning** rather than
  red-failing the suite.
- A JSON result with a pass-rate is written to `<step>/results/` (gitignored).

## Capturing a case

Each per-step eval has its own capture command. They all resolve the relevant
snapshot's (or iteration's) git coordinates, **validate both SHAs are fetchable**
(refusing to write a case with a dead SHA), and freeze the production loader's output
to disk. The reviewer captures additionally **probe every referenced S3 key** with the
production evidence loader so a media-rotated fixture is never written. All capture
commands read the DB; eval runs never touch it.

Capture **writes into the private corpus** at
`${DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR}/<step>/cases/<name>/`, so `DIFFS_EVAL_CASES_DIR` must be
set - the commands error with a clear message otherwise. After capturing, commit
the new case in the private `eval-cases` repo, never here.

```bash
pnpm --filter @autonoma/worker-diffs capture:analysis               <snapshotId>   [--name <case-name>] [--force]
pnpm --filter @autonoma/worker-diffs capture:generation-review      <generationId> [--name <case-name>] [--force]
pnpm --filter @autonoma/worker-diffs capture:replay-review          <runId>        [--name <case-name>] [--force]
pnpm --filter @autonoma/worker-diffs capture:healing                <iterationId>  [--name <case-name>] [--force]
pnpm --filter @autonoma/worker-diffs capture:healing-from-snapshot  <snapshotId>   [--name <case-name>] [--force]
```

A diffs **first turn** is captured with `capture:healing` like any other
iteration - pass iteration 1 of a diffs refinement loop. The capture buckets its
outcomes (affected-test replays have a run but no generation; the diffs agent's
new tests have a generation + run), so the frozen `input.json` carries those
`failures`.

**Pre-#986 / loop-less snapshots use `capture:healing-from-snapshot <snapshotId>`.**
Before the cut-over (#986), "resolution" ran outside the refinement loop, so those
snapshots have no `RefinementIteration` for `capture:healing` to start from. This
command reconstructs the same first-turn `HealingInput` straight from the snapshot:
failures from the affected-test replays (the plans diffs iteration 1 is seeded
from) and the change / analysis reasoning / per-failure lineage from the shared
`DiffJobContextLoader`. It is the migration path for the legacy resolution corpus,
and produces a fixture identical in shape to an iteration-based first-turn capture.
The suite (`existingTests` + flows) is read from the **previous** snapshot, because
pre-#986 resolution mutated this snapshot's own assignments (modify/remove) - the
previous snapshot holds the unmutated baseline the first turn saw, exactly as the
old `capture:resolution` did (the "Baseline snapshot state" note below).

(Replay review is failure-only - it refuses runs whose status is not `"failed"`,
mirroring production.) After capture, fill in the frontmatter checks and the rubric
in `expected.md`, then flip `skip: false`.

**Baseline snapshot state (Analysis).** Analysis grades against the snapshot as it stood _before_
this snapshot's pipeline ran. At production time the snapshot's own assignments are still that
baseline (analysis does not write to the suite), so the runner reads them directly. Capture,
however, runs _after_ the pipeline has rewritten those assignments, so it loads the baseline from
the snapshot's **previous** snapshot - the unmutated copy - to reproduce exactly what the step saw.
This is controlled by the `testSuiteSource` option on the shared `assembleDiffsAgentInput` loader
(`"current"` for the runner, `"previous"` for capture).

**Healing - bucketing.** Healing capture re-buckets the iteration's plan outcomes via the shared
`bucketIterationOutcomes` helper (the same code the `analyzeResults` activity uses at production
time). Those reads only touch rows that the rest of the pipeline never mutates by id
(`TestGeneration`, `Run`, their reviews; `update_plan` creates a _new_ `TestPlan` rather than
mutating the existing one, so iter-N+1's generations are keyed by a different `planId` and
filtered out). The bucketing reproduces exactly - including a **diffs first turn**, whose seeded
plans mix replay-only affected tests (a pre-existing test replayed against the diff has a `Run` but
no `TestGeneration`, bucketed by run outcome) and the diffs agent's new tests (a `TestGeneration` +
`Run`, bucketed by both).

**Per-failure diff-job context (Healing).** Healing assembles its input through the shared
`DiffJobContextLoader` (`loadHealingContext`), the same path the reviewers use, so
each failure now carries the full per-test refinement lineage (plan rewrites + earlier verdicts),
the snapshot's change facts (frozen as the top-level `change` + `analysisReasoning`), and the data
the failing subject's scenario actually seeded (`failures[].scenario`). Lineage and scenario are
sourced from historic, immutable rows (`RefinementIterationInput` / `RefinementAction` / earlier
`RunReview`s, and the `ScenarioInstance.generatedData` written once at UP success), so they never
drift. `failures[].affectedReason` / `affectedReasoning` / `lineage` / `scenario` are optional, so
fixtures captured before this still rehydrate. `change` and `analysisReasoning` are required -
healing runs against a checked-out head SHA, downstream of a successful analysis - though
`analysisReasoning` defaults to `""` on read for a fixture frozen before it was captured.

**Final-turn gating (Healing).** Capture also freezes the loop's iteration cap as `maxIterations`,
recovered from the iteration's `RefinementLoop.triggeredBy` (3 for both diffs and onboarding). The
eval runs the real `HealingAgent`, which withholds the retry tool (`update_plan`) when
`iteration === maxIterations`, so a final-turn fixture exercises the same triage-only tool set
production does. `maxIterations` defaults to `3` for a fixture frozen before it was captured.

**Live reads at capture (Reviewers).** Most reviewer inputs are immutable historic records
(conversation, steps, screenshots, video, the codebase clone, the agent's `reasoning`) or
schema-snapshotted at run/generation creation time (`run.plan` via `run.planId` -
`assignment.plan` is _not_ used, because `updatePlan` re-points the assignment to a new TestPlan
row). The remaining fields that capture re-reads live and can in principle drift between capture
and what production saw:

- **`testGeneration.status`** (the agent's self-reported status, surfaced as
  `selfReportedStatus`). The pipeline's `markAsFailed` path can retroactively set a stuck
  `pending` / `queued` generation to `failed`. Production reviews fire immediately so see the
  original status; capture later may see the mutated one. The reviewer treats this as a hint
  only, so it rarely changes the verdict.
- **`testCase.name`** (the human-readable test name). Mutable via test renames - the captured
  name may not match what the run originally executed. Doesn't influence the verdict; just a
  display string.

**Live application-level reads (Analysis + Healing).** A few fields are not snapshot-scoped and
are read live from the application at capture time:

- `testScopeGuidelines` (both steps) - free-text guidelines on the `Application` row. If the
  owner edits them between capture and eval run, the captured value will diverge from what
  production saw at the time.
- `scenarios` (analysis + healing) - the application's enabled scenarios (analysis exposes them so
  `create_test` can bind a `scenarioId`; healing for `update_plan` grounding). Scenarios are
  referenced by id, so if one is deleted between capture and eval run the frozen ids become stale.
- `folder list + names/descriptions` (analysis + healing, via `loadFlows` / the healing
  `planAuthoring` block) - the per-folder _test slugs_ are snapshot-scoped, but the folder
  metadata itself is read live. Folders cannot currently be product-edited, so this rarely drifts.

A capture against a freshly-finished snapshot is always faithful; an older snapshot may pick up
these drifts. Treat them the same way you treat flow / test ids in analysis cases: stable enough
in practice, but a re-capture is the fix if an eval starts drifting for reasons unrelated to the
agent.
