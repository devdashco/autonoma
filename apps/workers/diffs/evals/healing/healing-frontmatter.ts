/**
 * Deterministic checks for a Healing case.
 *
 * `expectedActions` grades the per-failure action union for the test cases a
 * rubric wants to pin exactly. Each entry pins the expected action kind for a
 * specific failing test case; omitted failures are not checked by this
 * deterministic grader and should be covered by the judge rubric or
 * `provenance` when their disposition matters. A modify is `update_plan`, a
 * removal is `remove_test`, and a bug is `report_bug` /
 * `report_engine_limitation`. Healing only heals and culls - it authors no
 * tests.
 *
 * `provenance` grades the remove-vs-keep rule. It is keyed by failing test
 * case and semantic rather than kind-exact:
 *   - `removed` - an invalid test authored *this* snapshot (or whose feature was
 *     deleted): the agent must `remove_test` it. Removal is failure-driven and
 *     citable - the runtime attaches a source review and rejects an uncitable
 *     removal - and `validateHealingCase` refuses a `removed` expectation whose
 *     failure carries no `reviewLink`, so a removal always cites a review.
 *   - `kept` - a *pre-existing* failing test, which is useful and must be
 *     kept: the agent must pick any keep action ({@link KEEP_KINDS})
 *     and must NOT `remove_test` it. This does not pin which keep
 *     mechanism, only that the test is not deleted.
 *
 * Anything subtler (was the rewritten plan sensible? was the bug severity
 * proportionate? is the cited removal reason plausible?) belongs in the judge
 * rubric, not here.
