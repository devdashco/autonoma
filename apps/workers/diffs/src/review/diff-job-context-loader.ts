/**
 * Gathers everything a diff-job agent needs from the database, at one of two
 * scopes:
 *
 * - **Subject scope** (`load` / `loadGeneration`): everything a reviewer needs
 *   for a single subject - a failed replay run **or** a test generation: the
 *   executed steps + test metadata, the subject-scoped change context (base/head
 *   SHAs, the diffs-agent's analysis reasoning, and why this test was flagged),
 *   the point-in-time refinement-loop lineage, and (for runs) the materialized
 *   scenario data.
 * - **Snapshot scope** (`loadSnapshot`): the same diff-job context gathered
 *   across *all* replayed runs in a snapshot, for agents that reason over the
 *   whole batch at once (resolution) rather than one subject.
 * - **Healing scope** (`loadHealingContext`): the diff-job context for one
 *   refinement iteration's failing subjects (failed generations *and* runs,
 *   supplied by the caller), each carrying its full per-test lineage, the shared
 *   change facts, and its materialized scenario data.
 *
 * This is the only piece of the diff-job path with DB access. It performs no git
 * or filesystem work - the agent derives the changed files and diff hunks itself
 * via `git diff` against the checked-out tree - which keeps the agent run
 * DB-free and the loader trivially testable against a real Postgres.
 *
 * Multimedia (step screenshots + video) stays referenced by S3 key only; an
 * `EvidenceLoader` rehydrates the bytes at run time. The generation conversation
 * is the one exception: it is text the reviewer inlines into the prompt (and
 * that the eval fixture freezes), so the loader resolves it eagerly from S3
 * here - which is why `loadGeneration` requires a storage provider.
