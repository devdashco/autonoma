# @autonoma/api

Backend API server for the Autonoma platform. Exposes a tRPC API over HTTP with Google OAuth authentication, GitHub webhook handling, and organization-based multi-tenancy.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node 22 (ESM-only)
- **HTTP Framework:** Hono
- **API Layer:** tRPC with SuperJSON transformer
- **Auth:** better-auth (Google OAuth, session-based, Redis-backed)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma (`@autonoma/db`)
- **Storage:** S3 via `@autonoma/storage`
- **Observability:** Sentry (logging, error tracking, tracing)
- **Analytics:** PostHog via `@autonoma/analytics`
- **Build:** tsup (bundled ESM, targets Node 22)

## Running

```bash
# From the monorepo root
pnpm dev           # starts API (port 4000) and UI (port 3000) concurrently

# From this directory
pnpm dev           # starts API with --env-file=../../.env and tsx watch
pnpm build         # production build via tsup
pnpm typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint          # biome check with auto-fix
pnpm test          # unit tests (vitest)
pnpm test:integration  # integration tests (vitest, Testcontainers)
```

## Environment Variables

Defined in `src/env.ts` using `@t3-oss/env-core` with Zod validation. Also extends env schemas from `@autonoma/db`, `@autonoma/logger`, and `@autonoma/storage`.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `API_PORT` | Yes | - | Port the server listens on (typically `4000`) |
| `METRICS_PORT` | No | `9464` | Dedicated port for the Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint (kept off `API_PORT` so the ingress never exposes it) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | - | Google OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | - | Google OAuth client secret |
| `REDIS_URL` | Yes | - | Redis connection URL (sessions, caching) |
| `APP_URL` | No | `http://localhost:3000` | Frontend URL for redirects |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | No | `http://localhost:3000` | Comma-separated CORS origins |
| `INTERNAL_DOMAIN` | No | `autonoma.app` | Domain for internal users and cross-subdomain cookies |
| `AGENT_VERSION` | No | `latest` | Version tag for Temporal worker agent images |
| `POSTHOG_KEY` | No | - | PostHog API key (analytics disabled if absent) |
| `POSTHOG_HOST` | No | `https://us.i.posthog.com` | PostHog ingest host |
| `LLM_PROXY_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Master switch for the managed LLM proxy (`/v1/llm-proxy`, planner CLI). Mounted only when this AND `STRIPE_ENABLED` are true. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | No | - | Server-side OpenRouter key the LLM proxy forwards with. Required for the proxy (`503` without it). |
| `LLM_PROXY_ALLOWED_MODELS` | No | planner model | Comma-separated allowlist of models the proxy may route. Defaults to `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`. |
| `LLM_PROXY_FREE_CREDIT_CAP` | No | `20000` | Max credits a never-paid org may spend through the proxy, out of its free-start grant. Credits the org has paid for (top-up purchases + subscription grants, net of refunds) raise the budget; an active subscription lifts it. Abuse guard against farmed free accounts draining credits via the CLI. |
| `LLM_PROXY_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | No | `32768` | Per-request `max_tokens` ceiling. The proxy clamps (and defaults) each request to this so an allowlisted model can't be driven with an unbounded generation. |
| `LLM_PROXY_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` | No | `16000000` | Per-request body-size ceiling (bytes). Sized to comfortably fit a full ~1M-token context-window request (which the planner legitimately builds) plus JSON/UTF-8 overhead; only blocks payloads several times the model's own limit. Oversized payloads are rejected with `413`. |
| `GITHUB_PR_CACHE_REVALIDATE_WINDOW_MINUTES` | No | `5` | Throttle window for the read-triggered PR-metadata cache revalidate (per app); one open-list call, plus one closed-list call when PRs need merged-vs-closed classification |
| `TESTING` | No | `false` | Test environment flag - prevents loading production modules |

Additionally, the inherited env schemas require database (`DATABASE_URL`), logger (`SENTRY_DSN`, `NODE_ENV`), and storage (`S3_BUCKET`, AWS credentials) variables.

## Prometheus Metrics

The API serves a Prometheus endpoint on `METRICS_PORT` (`src/metrics/metrics-server.ts`), scraped pod-direct via the `prometheus.io/*` annotations in `deployment/apps/api.yaml` - it is never routed through the Service or ingress. It exposes:

- Node.js process metrics (prom-client `collectDefaultMetrics`).
- `previewkit_app_builds_in_flight` (`src/metrics/previewkit-build-metrics.ts`): app image builds this env's previewkit runners currently have running on the shared warm buildkit pool, computed from the DB on each scrape (fresh `building` app rows on live environments; a 90-minute freshness window ages out rows leaked by a crashed runner). Every env's API exports its own view; the `previewkit:app_builds_in_flight:sum` recording rule (`deployment/prometheus/alert-rules.yaml`) dedupes replicas and sums envs into the pool-wide series that dashboards and autoscaling read.

```

### Managed LLM proxy (`/v1/llm-proxy`)

The planner CLI (`@autonoma-ai/planner`) runs on managed Autonoma credits instead of a
user-supplied OpenRouter key. It points its OpenRouter AI-SDK provider at
`${AUTONOMA_API_URL}/v1/llm-proxy` and authenticates with its Autonoma API token (same
`requireApiKey` path as `/v1/setup`).

The route is gated on `LLM_PROXY_ENABLED` (default `false`) so it is never an accidental
unmetered gateway - it is only mounted where explicitly enabled. Metering requires
`STRIPE_ENABLED=true`; when the proxy is enabled with billing off (e.g. a test environment)
requests are served but **not** metered and a startup warning is logged. The proxy:

1. Bounds the raw request body to `LLM_PROXY_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` (`413 request_too_large` otherwise).
2. Enforces a model allowlist (`LLM_PROXY_ALLOWED_MODELS`, default = the single model the planner uses, `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`).
3. Runs the credit gate (`checkLlmProxyGate`, all refusals are `402` so the CLI surfaces a billing hint):
   - `out_of_credits` - the wallet is empty.
   - `grace_period_expired` - subscription payment overdue.
   - `free_cli_limit_reached` - a never-paid org has spent its free CLI allowance (`LLM_PROXY_FREE_CREDIT_CAP`, default 20k of the 100k free-start grant). Credits the org has paid for (top-up purchases + subscription grants, net of refunds) raise the budget one-for-one, so a paying/formerly-paying org is never blocked at the free cap; an active subscription lifts the cap outright. This is the primary abuse bound: a farmed free account can drain at most the cap through the CLI, regardless of concurrency.
4. Clamps `max_tokens` to `LLM_PROXY_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (and sets it when omitted) so a single request stays cheap - keeping any overspend past the cap under concurrency negligible.
5. Forwards `chat/completions` to OpenRouter with the server `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, streaming the
   response back unchanged.
6. Meters the dollar cost OpenRouter reports (usage accounting) into credits at the top-up rate and
   deducts from `BillingCustomer.creditBalance`, recording a `LLM_PROXY_CONSUMPTION` transaction
   (idempotent on the OpenRouter generation id). Surfaced in the billing UI as "AI CLI usage".

Returns `503` when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is unset.

**Known limitation (concurrency):** the balance gate and the deduction are separate reads, so an
org near zero balance that fires N concurrent requests can have all N served (each costing real
OpenRouter tokens) while the balance only floors at zero. Per-call cost is tiny and the gate still
blocks once the wallet is empty, so the overspend is bounded; tighten with per-API-key rate limiting
(the `ApiKey` model already carries `rateLimit*` fields) or an atomic check-and-reserve if CLI volume
grows.

### PreviewKit topology suggestions

The onboarding PreviewKit builder proposes apps, services, and env vars from the linked repo,
backed by three collaborators in `src/github/`:

- `RepoReader` - shared read-only repo access (installation client, per `(repo, head SHA)` file-tree
  cache, and `package.json` / file-content readers). Reused by both services below so they share one
  tree cache.
- `RepoIntrospectionService` - deterministic app detection (workspace globs, Dockerfiles, frameworks,
  ports). Surfaced via `onboarding.introspectRepository`.
- `PreviewkitSuggestionService` - AI-assisted, heuristic-backed service and env-var suggestions.
  Deterministic heuristics (package.json deps, `docker-compose` images, `.env.example` keys) run
  first and always; a Gemini pass (`ObjectGenerator`) then refines them with evidence. Surfaced via
  `onboarding.suggestPreviewkitServices` and `onboarding.suggestPreviewkitEnvVars`.

`@autonoma/ai` is imported lazily inside `PreviewkitSuggestionService` (its provider keys are only
required on first suggestion, never at API boot), and any AI failure degrades to the heuristic result
so suggestions never block onboarding. Suggestions are computed on demand and never persisted.

### tRPC Routers

Each router is thin wiring - business logic lives in the corresponding service class. Routers are defined in `src/routes/` and composed in `src/routes/router.ts`.

| Router | Service | Domain |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `admin` | `AdminService` | Admin operations |
| `auth` | `AuthService` | User and session management |
| `applications` | `ApplicationsService` | Test target applications |
| `branches` | `BranchesService` | Test suite branches |
| `folders` | `FoldersService` | Test organization |
| `runs` | `RunsService` | Test execution runs |
| `generations` | `TestGenerationsService` | AI test generation |
| `tests` | `TestsService` | Test cases |
| `scenarios` | `ScenariosService` | Execution scenarios |
| `github` | `GitHubInstallationService` | GitHub app integrations |
| `issues` | `IssuesService` | Test issues and reviews |
| `onboarding` | `OnboardingService` | User onboarding |
| `snapshotEdit` | `SnapshotEditService` | Snapshot editing |

### Procedure Types

Defined in `src/trpc.ts`:

- **`publicProcedure`** - No auth required. Has Sentry tracing and error mapping middleware.
- **`protectedProcedure`** - Requires authenticated user with an active organization.
- **`internalProcedure`** - Requires admin role.

### Error Handling

Custom `APIError` subclasses (`NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `BadRequestError`, `InternalError`) are automatically mapped to tRPC error codes via middleware. Unhandled errors are logged as fatal via Sentry.

### Dependency Injection

Services are built in `src/routes/build-services.ts` via plain constructor injection - no DI framework. The `createContext` function in `src/context.ts` assembles the full tRPC context (database, auth session, services) for each request.
