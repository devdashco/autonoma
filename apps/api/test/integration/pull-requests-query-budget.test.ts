/**
 * Performance budgets for the database queries issued when the pull-request pages load.
 *
 * These assert the NUMBER of SQL statements a procedure issues, not wall-clock time, because query
 * count is deterministic (machine-independent, no flakiness on CI runners) and is exactly the thing
 * that regresses into slowness: per-item round-trips (N+1). The budgets run against the real
 * Testcontainers/CI Postgres the rest of the integration suite uses, so they need no special setup.
 *
 * When a budget breaks: do not just bump the number. A higher count almost always means a query was
 * added inside a loop or a `Promise.all(items.map(...))`. Batch it into a single bulk query first.
 * Only raise a budget when the extra queries are genuinely unavoidable, and say why in the diff.

// Measured constant cost is ~30 SQL statements (the nested-include reads expand to several

// the snapshot. The open-bug-count read lets the checkpoint summary separate real app bugs from
// execution state (countOpenBugsBySnapshot resolves its generationReview/runReview
// relation chains as a couple of statements). Budget is current + headroom: a coarse net. The slope

// card multiplies it by the snapshot count.

// baseline is 6/snapshot today - snapshotHistory already fans `summarizeChangesForSnapshot` out per
// snapshot. This caps that at its current cost so it cannot get worse without someone noticing.
