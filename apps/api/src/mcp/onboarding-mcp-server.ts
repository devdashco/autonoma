const ONBOARDING_INSTRUCTIONS = `Autonoma runs your end-to-end tests against a preview deployment of your app. These tools let a coding agent configure that preview during onboarding: set up the build, databases, services and env, deploy off the main branch, and iterate until it comes up - while the user watches read-only in the Autonoma UI.

Start every session by pairing:
1. The user starts onboarding in the Autonoma UI and clicks "Configure with coding agent". The UI shows a short pairing CODE.
2. Call pair(code) with it. That claims the app's config for you and returns its applicationId and current config. Use that applicationId for every other tool.

Then loop until the preview is up:
3. get_config(applicationId) - read the current preview config.
4. apply_config(applicationId, document) - save the FULL config document (call get_config first, edit it, send the whole thing back). It is validated on save; if invalid, the error tells you what to fix.
5. If the app needs secret env values (third-party API keys, tokens) you do NOT have: call request_env(applicationId, keys). NEVER put secret values in any tool call - you cannot, there is no tool that takes them. The user enters them in the Autonoma UI. ALWAYS ask the user first whether to set env on Autonoma from their .env (the default, they paste it into the UI) or configure them manually. Never request AUTONOMA_* variables (AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT, AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT_PR, AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT_URL, AUTONOMA_SHARED_SECRET, AUTONOMA_SIGNING_SECRET) - Autonoma injects all of them automatically and rejects attempts to set them. Non-secret config (e.g. NODE_ENV) belongs in apply_config as an app connection, and so does the URL of a service that lives INSIDE the preview (its own Postgres, Redis, ...) - that URL only exists at deploy time, so wire it as a connection instead of asking the user for it.
6. trigger_deploy(applicationId) - deploy the main branch (environment 0).
7. get_session_status(applicationId) - poll this for both "is the build done" and "did the user answer my request". It returns the deploy status, the preview URL, diagnostics, and your control state. While a request is pending, do NOT tell the user to come back and confirm here - they answer in the Autonoma UI and may never return to this chat. Keep polling until pendingRequest clears, then continue on your own.
8. When status shows the preview is up, verify it yourself: curl the preview URL, or write a small Playwright script if the user has Playwright, and check you get what you expect. If it is broken, read the diagnostics, fix the config, and loop.

Control: you hold the config while you work; the UI is read-only. If get_session_status (or any write) reports the user took over (standDown / paused), STOP configuring and let them - do not fight for control. They can hand it back with "Resume with Claude" and you re-claim on your next call. If you go idle for a while the UI hands control back automatically; just resume when the user asks.`;
