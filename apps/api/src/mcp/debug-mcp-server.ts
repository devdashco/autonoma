const DEBUG_INSTRUCTIONS = `Autonoma runs your end-to-end tests against a per-PR preview deployment of your app and reviews the result. When a preview fails to build or deploy, or a test fails because the app is broken, these tools let you read the live evidence and fix the cause in this repo.

Every tool is keyed by repoFullName ("owner/repo"). You almost never need to ask the user for it:
- It is this repository's GitHub remote. Infer it from the working directory (e.g. run \`git remote get-url origin\` and parse "owner/repo"). Use that directly.
- Only if you are not inside the app's repo, or can't determine the remote, call list_apps to see the repos you can debug and ask the user which one.
You do NOT need GitHub access - repoFullName is just how Autonoma identifies your app; the org is inferred from it and you must be a member.

Recommended flow when Autonoma flags a problem on a pull request:
1. Call get_deploy_status(repoFullName, prNumber) to see which service is unhealthy and whether it failed at build or at runtime.
2. If a service failed to BUILD: call get_build_logs (start with from="tail" to see the failure; use from="head" for the start of the build). Missing build inputs often show up as a missing env var.
3. If a service BUILT but crashes or errors at RUNTIME: call get_app_logs (from="tail" for the crash, from="head" for startup).
4. Call diagnose_deploy(repoFullName, prNumber) to get all the raw evidence in one call - status, each service/addon state, the latest build outcome, a rule-based failure classification, the config's env-key surface, and error-shaped logs - plus deterministic findings categorized as a missing env var, a setup problem, or a platform error. Reason over the signals yourself; a "platform error" (autonoma_error) is on Autonoma, so contact support rather than editing your repo.
5. Call get_secret_status(repoFullName) to see the full env-var surface per app: topology connections (with their template values) and secret-backed vars (declared build secrets + registered runtime secrets), including which declared build secrets are missing. Secret VALUES are never returned - only presence and masked length.
6. Apply the fix. Two kinds:
   - A missing secret VALUE (an API key, token, password): call set_secret(repoFullName, prNumber, app, key, value). It stores the value and rebuilds or restarts the service automatically.
   - How the app is built or wired (build path, Dockerfile, port, health check, which keys are injected at build, topology connections): call edit_previewkit_config(repoFullName, prNumber, app, ...the fields to change). It saves a new config revision and rebuilds the service.
   For anything in your source (code, a committed Dockerfile), edit this repo and push - Autonoma re-runs on the new commit.
7. set_secret and edit_previewkit_config trigger the rebuild/restart asynchronously. Call wait_for_deploy(repoFullName, prNumber, app) to block until it settles, then re-check status/logs. If it returns settled:false, the deploy is still running - call it again.

Live vs. forensic surface: get_deploy_status, get_endpoints, and wait_for_deploy read the LIVE environment, which Autonoma tears down after testing - once it is gone they return status: "unavailable". The LOGS (get_build_logs, get_app_logs) are different: they persist ~30 days independent of the live environment. So an "unavailable" deploy status does NOT mean the logs are gone. For a post-mortem of a past deploy ("why did this PR's last preview fail?"), call the log tools directly even when status is unavailable.

Keys: every tool takes repoFullName ("owner/repo"); the per-PR tools also take prNumber. The organization is inferred from the repo (which you must be a member of), so everything is automatically scoped to it.`;

After you push a PR, Autonoma reviews its preview deploy. If it flagged a problem, use the Autonoma MCP tools to find the cause (get_deploy_status, diagnose_deploy, get_build_logs, get_app_logs, get_secret_status), fix it (set_secret for a missing secret value, edit_previewkit_config for build/wiring changes), and confirm with wait_for_deploy - before merging. The tools take this repo as "owner/repo" - infer it from the git remote; if unsure, call list_apps.`;
