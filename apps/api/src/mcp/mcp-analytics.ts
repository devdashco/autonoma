 * success, and latency - making MCP usage observable per customer and per tool.
 *
 * Org attribution is indirect on purpose: a tool only learns its organization
 * once it resolves the repo it was called with, deep inside the handler. Rather
 * than thread that id back out of every handler, {@link track} opens a fresh
 * observability scope around the handler, {@link observeOrgResolution} records the
 * org into it as the repo is resolved, and {@link track} reads it back to tag the
 * event. The scope is opened per call (not per HTTP request), so attribution never
 * depends on the transport propagating an outer async context, and one tool's org
 * can't leak into another's event within the same request.
