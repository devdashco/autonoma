const PRIMER = `## Background - what you are looking at

The Autonoma SDK lets a developer seed and tear down test data through a single HTTP endpoint on their own backend (the "Environment Factory"). For each database entity the developer registers a *factory* with two functions: a create() that inserts records, and a teardown() that deletes them. Their handler code calls into their app's real service/ORM layer.

A separate tool (not the developer) generates the *recipe*: JSON test data, one array of records per entity. Each record may carry an "_alias" (a unique handle, e.g. "account_1") and "_ref" fields ({ "_ref": "account_1" }) that point at an alias declared by an already-created parent entity. The tool sends this recipe to the endpoint:
- An **UP** request asks the factory to create the records (calls create()).
- A **DOWN** request asks the factory to tear them down (calls teardown()).

So a failure has exactly two possible origins, and your only job is to tell them apart:`;

export function buildClassifierPrompt(args: ClassifyArgs): string {
    const errorText = typeof args.error === "string" ? args.error : JSON.stringify(args.error, null, 2);
    const phaseLine =
        args.phase === "teardown"
            ? `This was a DOWN (teardown) request. Teardown runs the developer's delete logic against data the create() step already accepted, so teardown failures are usually implementation-side (wrong delete order, foreign-key cleanup bugs) rather than caused by the recipe.`
            : `This was an UP (create) request - the factory tried to insert the recipe records.`;
    const statusLine =
        args.httpStatus != null
            ? `HTTP status: ${args.httpStatus}. (A 5xx usually means the handler threw; a 4xx is more often a rejected payload, but use the error text - status alone is not decisive.)`
            : `No HTTP status (the request threw before a response - often a network/server-process problem, lean implementation or unclear).`;

    return `${PRIMER}

- RECIPE DATA is wrong - the JSON the tool sent doesn't fit the developer's (correct) schema. Examples of the *kind* of problem (not an exhaustive list): the request body references an alias (_ref) that no record in THIS SAME request declares with an _alias, a field holds a value the backend rejects, a required field is missing or an unknown field was sent, or a value has the wrong type. These are fixable by regenerating the data - the developer's code is fine. NOTE: an error like "references unknown alias(es): X" is recipe-side whenever X is not declared by an _alias in the test data shown below - the SDK resolves _refs WITHIN the request body, so it does not matter whether X appears in the "valid targets" list (that list is historical context about other entities' own runs, NOT the contents of this request).
- IMPLEMENTATION is wrong - the developer's own handler/factory code is broken. Examples of the *kind* of problem: the factory for this entity is not registered, the handler references a column or table that does not exist (even though the recipe never mentioned it), the insert/delete logic has a bug, or the server threw an unhandled exception. No change to the test data can fix this; the developer must edit code.

## How to decide

Ask: "Would sending DIFFERENT, corrected test data - still matching the intended schema - plausibly make this request succeed?"
- If yes → **recipe**.
- If the data shown below looks valid and the error points at the server's own logic, a missing factory, or a column/table the recipe never referenced → **implementation**.
- If you genuinely cannot tell from the evidence → **unclear**. Prefer "unclear" over a confident guess; a wrong confident answer is worse than admitting uncertainty.

Cross-check the error against the actual data sent below before deciding. For an "unknown alias" error, look at whether a record in the test data declares that alias with an _alias - NOT at the valid-targets list. If the alias the error names is missing from (or spelled differently in) the data we sent, it is recipe-side, even when that alias appears in the valid-targets list.

## Evidence

${phaseLine}
${statusLine}

Entity: "${args.entityName}"

Valid _ref targets (aliases declared by already-created parent entities):
${args.validRefAliases?.trim() || "(none - this is a root entity with no parents to reference)"}

What the entity audit recorded about how "${args.entityName}" is created:
${args.entityAudit?.trim() || "(not available)"}

${args.liveSchema?.trim() || "(no live schema available - the /discover endpoint was unreachable)"}

Test data sent:
${JSON.stringify(args.recipe, null, 2)}

Error:
${errorText}`;
