Rank from MOST important to LEAST important:
- HIGH: entities that many others depend on, and entities representing the primary concepts of the domain - the accounts, users, workspaces/tenants, and core business objects a developer would name first when describing the product.
- LOW: peripheral entities - feature-specific records, integration/audit/logging details, join tables, and narrow or client-specific tables a developer would not have top of mind.

Use the audit below as your only source of truth. The "created_by" relationships and how often an entity owns/spawns others are strong signals of importance.

Return EVERY entity name from the audit, each exactly once, ordered most-important first. Use the names exactly as written in the audit. Do not invent, rename, merge, or omit any entity.${feedback ? `\n\n${feedback}` : ""}
