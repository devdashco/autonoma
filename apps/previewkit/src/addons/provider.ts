/**
 * Plugin contract for third-party addons. Each provider lives behind this
 * interface — Neon for Postgres branches today, with PlanetScale / Upstash /
 * webhook escape hatches as natural follow-ups.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - On PR open / push, `AddonManager.provisionAll` calls `provision` once
 *     per addon declared in the preview config. The returned `outputs` are
 *     surfaced into the template engine so apps can reference
 *     `{{addonName.<key>}}` in env and build_args; `state` is persisted
 *     opaquely on the `PreviewkitAddon` row and replayed verbatim to
 *     `deprovision` at teardown.
 *   - On PR close, `deprovision` cleans up the external resource. Providers
 *     should be idempotent on this path — the manager will not retry by
 *     itself, but operators may re-run teardown manually.
 *
 * Providers must never read `process.env`; everything they need (options,
 * authSecret, identity) arrives via the input object. Construction is plain
 * `new NeonProvider()` registered into `AddonProviderRegistry` at boot.
