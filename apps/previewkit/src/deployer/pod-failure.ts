 * `ErrImagePull` is deliberately NOT included: it is the FIRST pull failure and
 * the kubelet may still succeed on retry (e.g. an image just pushed to ECR that
 * is still propagating). Once the kubelet gives up and backs off, the reason
 * becomes `ImagePullBackOff`, which IS terminal and is in the set - so excluding

 * Ready - `ContainerCreating`, a first-attempt `ErrImagePull`, or an
 * unschedulable `Pending` whose node Karpenter may still be provisioning. Those
 * states are bounded by the caller's deploy timeout, not failed early.
