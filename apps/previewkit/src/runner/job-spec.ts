/**
 * The payload a deploy/teardown runner Job carries in its PREVIEWKIT_JOB_SPEC

 * boundary where it is parsed and Zod-validated (the JSON crosses from the Job
 * spec into the runner as untrusted input, so it is checked rather than
 * trusted).
 *
 * Contract: keep `event` in sync with `PreviewDeployEvent` (`@autonoma/types`)
 * - the `satisfies` below fails the build if the schema drifts from the
 * interface - and with the object the launcher builds in
 * `apps/api/src/previewkit/previewkit-job-launcher.ts`.
